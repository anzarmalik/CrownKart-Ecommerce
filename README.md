# Simple & Basic Ecommerce in Node.js


This is a very basic example of Ecommerce CRUD in Node.js and express framework .
I have applied REST based API recommendations and custom MVC architecture .
I have applied Passport login  local strategy  http://www.passportjs.org/ 
I have used mySql and Sequelize ORM (associations are done using ORM ) https://sequelize.org/master/. 
I have written some basic test cases ( unit and integeration testing ) using Js testing framework Jest  https://jestjs.io/ .
I have also used eslint module for finding and fixing problems in my code .
